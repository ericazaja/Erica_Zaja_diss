BLM REA CYR 2013 Summer Range of Porcupine Herd

This dataset was developed for the BLM Rapid Ecoregional Assessment for the Central Yukon study area and represents a generalized summer range for the Terrestrial Fine-Filter Conservation Element caribou: Porcupine Herd. The Alaska Habitat Management Guide, published 1985 to 1986 by Alaska Department of Fish and Game, include seasonal ranges of caribou herds in Alaska. Although now outdated, the Alaska Habitat Management Guide still provides the best generalized spatial distribution information for many caribou herds in Alaska. Seasonal Ranges of Caribou Herds in Alaska is a spatial dataset based primarily on the Alaska Habitat Management Guide and modified by expert opinion and management reports. The Seasonal Ranges of Caribou Herds in Alaska provided a summer range for the Porcupine Herd that was modified slightly to fit within the total annual range. Caribou radio/satellite collar location data were not made available to Alaska Center for Conservation Science by the Porcupine Caribou Management Board. This dataset represents a best estimate of summer range in the absence of kernel density analysis using the same methods as was done for the annual kernel densities produced for this assessment.
